# Working-with-Facts-and-Dimension-Tables

This project focuses on the process of designing a data warehouse for a cloud service provider. It utilizes billing data provided in a CSV file to create a star schema, including the design of fact and dimension tables. This schema will support complex queries related to billing, such as average billing per customer, billing by country, industry, and category, as well as trends over time.

## Objectives

- Design and implement a star schema for billing data
- Create fact and dimension tables to support complex billing queries
- Analyze billing data to derive insights such as average billing per customer, billing by country, industry, and category
- Identify trends in billing over time

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the billing data from the provided CSV file.
2. **Schema Design**: Design the star schema by identifying fact and dimension tables.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform the billing data to fit into the star schema.
4. **Query Execution**: Execute complex queries to analyze billing data.

## Queries Supported

- Average billing per customer
- Billing by country
- Billing by industry
- Billing by category
- Trends in billing over time

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of designing a data warehouse using billing data, creating a star schema, and executing complex queries to derive meaningful insights.
